== Description ==

Hints enables you to provide a better UX with respect to links/topics. Some keywords/words, need more explanation or/and external resources to be explained further, if the user needs to know more. Normally, you would achieve this by creating a link/anchor to that resource. Hints, makes it possible for your users to get additional information, about a topic/resource, without leaving your post. Too many links in a post, do spoil the broth.

`[hints unique_id="options" custom_text="info about options"] 'unique_id' identifies each infocard or hint uniquely. As the option name suggests, the id has to be unique.

Using this option, may prove to be redundant.[/hints]`
